''' Event Monitoring and Tracking '''

# Event Monitoring
#
# When 'True', the event messages will print out to the screen according to
# the settings that follow. Logging will occur either way. Even though this
# setting will not affect logging, the following settings will.
#
# When 'False', all of the below settings will be irrelevant to the screen
# output. However, the settings that follow will affect the logging process.
#
monitor_events = True

# Reporting Basics
#
# This includes three items: 
#		- the input name given
#		- each word in the given name, within a list
#		- the number of words (or frags for fragments) in the name
#
# In the following example, it produces the flagged parts of the output:
#
#	 Input: North Coit Road 		<---
#	 ['North', 'Coit', 'Road']		<---
#	 Frag_num: 3					<---
#	 Prefix: North
#	 Suffix: Road
#	 Result: N Coit Rd
#
report_basics = True


# Reporting Input Value
#
# This is an alternative to reporting the basics and could be used when less event 
# information is desired for printing out on the screen during runtime. It can be
# useful for easier comparison between the input value and the output value (result).
#
# This includes only one item: 
#		- the input name given
#
# In the following example, it produces the flagged part of the output:
#
#	 Input: North Coit Road 		<---
#	 Prefix: North
#	 Suffix: Road
#	 Result: N Coit Rd
#
report_input = False


# Reporting Lateral Name Parts
#
# Prints out the prefix and suffix of the provided street name, for visual
# inspection of the values to gain more insight over the data.
#
# This includes two items: 
#		- the prefix of the input name given
#		- the suffix of the input name given
#
# In the following example, it produces the flagged parts of the output:
#
#	 Input: North Coit Road
#	 Prefix: North					<---
#	 Suffix: Road  					<---
#	 Result: N Coit Rd
#
report_lateral_name_parts = True


# Reporting the Result
#
# Shows the result of the reformatting/cleaning process.
#
# This includes only one item: 
#		- the resulting string after reformatting the given input name
#
# In the following example, it produces the flagged part of the output:
#
#	 Input: North Coit Road
#	 Prefix: North
#	 Suffix: Road
#	 Result: N Coit Rd 				<---
#
report_result = True


# Reporting Errors
#
# This signal will induce the printing of error messages onto the screen.
#
# Note: all errors will be logged in the .../log/error_log.json file, regardless.
#
# This includes only one item: 
#		- the resulting string after reformatting the given input name
#
# Example:
# ...
# No good fragments were found in this string.
# No bad fragments were found in this string.
# 
# Error: street name value "TX 78" is a problematic string and will not be processed.
#
# Greenville Ave
# Input: Greenville Ave
# ['Greenville', 'Ave']
# ...
#
report_errors = True						# prints error messages


# Tabbed Output
# 
# For visual differentiation between regular and operational/troubled activity,
# tabbing can be useful. In this case, the normal reformatting activity, such as
# changing "North Arapaho Road" to "N Arapaho Rd", will be tabbed, along with other
# minor contributions to the process (removing periods; switching word placement). 
#
# Operational activities, such as switching directories and producing logs, will not 
# be tabbed. Troubled activities, such as scanning problematic strings, will not be
# tabbed either. This way, the analyst can more easily focus on either type of activity 
# as needed during the analysis and/or troubleshooting process.
# 
# Here is an example of tabbed output:
#
# ...
# Deep scan is complete.
# Result: *highway_code
#
#	  Input: Greenville Ave
#	  ['Greenville', 'Ave']
#	  frag_num: 2
#	  Prefix: Greenville
#	  ----Warning: prefix dictionary may not have been sufficient to support: Greenville
#	  Suffix: Ave (expected)
#	  Result: Greenville Ave
#
#	  Input: Greenville Ave
#	  ['Greenville', 'Ave']
#	  frag_num: 2
#	  ...
# ...
#
# An example of untabbed output:
#
# ...
# Nothing has been found by the Out-of-Scope scan.
# Running Word-by-Word scan and build...
# Searching for '5223'
# ----It's a potential housenumber.
# Searching for 'alpha'
# Searching for 'road'
# ----It's a potential mistyped suffix.
# Searching for 'dallas'
# ----It's a potential city.
# Searching for 'tx'
# ----It's a potential state.
# Searching for '75240'
# ----It's a potential zipcode.
# Deep scan is complete.
# Result: Alpha Road
#
# Input: Alpha Road
# ['Alpha', 'Road']
# frag_num: 2
# Prefix: Alpha
# ----Warning: prefix dictionary may not have been sufficient to support: Alpha
# Suffix: Road
# Result: Alpha Rd
#
# Cleaning problematic string value...
# No comma issues found.
# Beginning deep scan...
# ...
#
tabbed = True

# Prevent duplicate printing of the input name
